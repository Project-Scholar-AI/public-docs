## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API Endpoints provided are authenticated using a ScholarAI API token. You can request a token from the following [link](https://app.scholarai.io/profile/api)

When hitting the ScholarAI endpoints, provide the API key as a header with the following format:

`X-ScholarAI-API-Key: [your token]`
