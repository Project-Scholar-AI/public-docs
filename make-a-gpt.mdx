title: Make A GPT
description: 'Make your own implementation of ScholarAI to work with ChatGPT'

## Use this guide if you...

- Use ChatGPT as your interface
- Want to keep all of the core functionality of ScholarAI while changing prompting to work with your process
- Or have different endpoints you'd like to use alongside ScholarAI's endpoints

## Setting up the GPT with no changes

### Get an API Key

Go to [the API key request page](https://app.scholarai.io/profile/api) and copy a generated key

### Creating the GPT

Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and create a new GPT

![view_gpt.png](/images/view_gpt.png)

Click on the `Configure` tab on the left panel, then scroll down to "Create a New Action" and select the option.

![create_action.png](/images/create_action.png)

Click on the Gear icon next to the `Authentication` section

![open_auth.png](/images/open_auth.png)

For the `Authentication Type`, select `API Key`. Paste your copied API key into the field below.

Then, under `Auth Type`, click `Custom` and type `X-ScholarAI-API-Key`. Hit Save!

### Prompting

Click `Import` then fill the value with `https://api.scholarai.io/openapi.yaml`

Once imported, you should see the `Schema` field fill with a bunch of content.

Click the `<` button to go back to the configure tab. Assign the GPT whatever name and description you'd like - these won't impact the prompting.

For the instruction, we use the following prompt. We recommend copying and pasting this in, then refining it to suit your usage:

```
ScholarAI is designed to proficiently sift through extensive scientific databases, presenting research references by default to maintain a balance between breadth and detail. ALL papers discussed MUST be linked using formatted hyperlinks ([Author 1 et al.](URL)) using web browsing if one is not presented. Its capabilities include utilizing 'search_abstracts' for concise summaries for general requests, 'literature_map' to explore connected research, 'getFullText' for in-depth PDF analysis, and 'question' for answering questions about a paper. ALWAYS use the 'question` feature to answer questions about specific papers. In any case where the detail provided by search is lacking information, use get_paper_metadata on identifiers or getFullText on pdf_urls to get more information. Use generative mode by default, and ALWAYS provide the landing page or pdf urls for every discussed answer.

When handling questions about features or usage, ALWAYS copy the content of the knowledge.md file directly.
```

Congrats! You should now be able to test your ScholarAI integration in the right panel.

## Customization

If you'd like to refine the prompting of the ScholarAI integration, the two main places to do that are

- The instruction field, which guides high level behavior of the GPT like output format and ways it should string together multiple calls to our API
- The imported schema, which tells the GPT what each part of our API represents.

We do not recommend modifying the imported schema as we've written these to ensure the different endpoints know how to interweave their functionality.

The instruction field can be manually written to from the interface, or you can use the `Create` tab to speak to ChatGPT and ask it to help you design the experience you'd like. In either case, the changes only take effect once you've saved.

## Staying up-to-date

We may frequently update the schema and features we have present. If you see a feature update from us,

1. Click the name of your custom GPT in the top left corner
2. Click `Edit GPT` to open the editor interface
3. Under the `Configure` tab, click the action named `api.scholarai.io`
4. Reimport the schema previously referenced
