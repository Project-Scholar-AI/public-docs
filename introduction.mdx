## Alpha Details

As we've grown, we've seen an increasing interest from both non-developer researchers and indie hackers in using our API for our paper searching vector database, paper content extraction, and project management features.

Our home has always been building APIs designed specifically for interacting with LLMs which drives many of the design decision and underlying infrastructure of the current API. We recognize and would love continued feedback on where this product needs to be better to serve you!

Please note that we are always iterating and changing our underlying systems, so anticipate change, including potentially breaking ones - we're building alongside you!
